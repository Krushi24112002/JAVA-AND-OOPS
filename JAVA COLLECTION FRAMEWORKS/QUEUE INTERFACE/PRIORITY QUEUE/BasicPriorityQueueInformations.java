// Priority Queue
/*

Priority Queue :-
-> A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority.
It is known that a Queue follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm,
but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be processed according to the priority, 
thatâ€™s when the PriorityQueue comes into play.

-> The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap.
