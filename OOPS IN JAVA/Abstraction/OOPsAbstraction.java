// Abstraction in java(OOPs)
// Defintion:- Data Abstraction is The Process Of Hiding Certain Details And Showing Only Essential Information To The User.

# Important Points In Abstract Class

1) An instance of an abstract class can not be created.
2) Constructors are allowed.
3) We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.
4) There can be a final method in abstract class but any abstract method in class(abstract class) can not be declared as final.
5) We can define static methods in an abstract class
6) We can use the abstract keyword for declaring top-level classes (Outerclass) as well as inner classes as abstract
7) If a class contains at least one abstract method then compulsory should declare a class as abstract
8) If the Child class is unable to provide implementation to all abstract methods of the Parent class then we should declare that Child class as
abstract so that the next level Child class should provide implementation to the remaining abstract method

# Advantages Of Abstraction #
1) Only you can make changes to your data or function, and no one else can.
2) Increases the reusability of the code.
3) Avoids duplication of your code.
4) It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the Background details.
